## General info
App works with mock server which delivers you logins and passwords to already created projects (also data will be randomized each time with Faker.js).  
There are 3 roles: Developer, who works to resolve bugs; Tester, who works to run test cases and reports bugs and Project Manager, who invited and deletes users from project. Some routes are secured so you need to log in to enter them. Authorization uses JWT.  
Logged user will be able to see dashboard with charts and statistics about current project.  
App delivers 404 page, error page (built with React Error Boundary), spinners for asynchronous loading and notifications for actions for better UX.
